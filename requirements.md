## Overview

Create a fun interactive toy for children around the age of 2 years, which is made of mainly wood but uses electronics undernearth. The toy should have a display and user input and the display should change depending on the user input.

### Important Points

- Toy must be safe for a child to use unsupervisors, so no small loose parts and no coin cell battery and use safe materials and adhesives (if required)
- The structure must be made of wood
- Cost is a considerations but not top priority 

### General Game Play

The idea of the toy, is that the child with use some sort of input such as a button to cause the screen to display a visuallisation of what was on the button, for example is the child presses a button with a heart on it, the toy wood show a red beating heart. It is as simple as that the idea is that the child will enjoy the animations of the display based on what they press. 

### Input

I am unsure on what input to have, currently considering buttons, or using NFID Tags, i would like to keep the exterior of the toy all wood, so having wooden buttons maybe tricky, but safer as they are not loose. I could use NFID tags embedded in a wood 'card' that is large so is safe, that could be pressed against the device to active the display, the downside to this is that these cards could be lost. I will consider other options for inputs that you can suggest, please give a good reason for using them if you do. The input should have a basic picture of what it causes the display to do. For example a star button would display a star. It should also have some form of on / off button to ensure power is not wasted. 

### Display 

I want to use a coloured dot matrix display that is good enought to display at least basic animations. A beating heart, i spinning star. The display should fill must of the devices front. The display will be behind the wood so will shine through it, i understand this can be done with wood veener, but please suggest otherwise, if it can't. Or give other options. 

### Enclosure

The toy must be mainly made of wood, the externior should be all wood, unless buttons are required for example on and off switches. I do not have access to a 3D printer, so the electronics inside most be held in place by wood, or glue or other non plastic means. The front of the device should also be wood, so when off, it just looks like a wood square or rectangle.

### Dimensions

At least 12 cm by 12cm in the front, can be at much as 15 cm by 15 cm, or bigger if the desired display is bigger. The depth of the toy, has no strict requirement, but the device must be fairly easy for the child to hold and carry. 

### Electronics

The builder has had experience with both arduino and raspberry pi, but they are looking for the quickest was to build a usable prototype so requires the use of pre made shields / boards over making pcbs or using breadboards. 

### software 

open to options here but if there are some software options that provide an easy way to create the animations on the display that would speed up development

### Construction

For the wood wok, the builder has all basic manual wood work tools, and also a power mitre saw, a track saw, drill and jigswa.

### Time

The builder is interested in getting a prototype created quickly so they can see if it works, before refining the design. 

### Power

Ideally a rechargable power source, but open to other safe options. 

### Questions

The builder is open to any questions, or requirments that need clarifying.
