# Dot Matrix Wooden Toy - Project Summary

## Overview
An interactive wooden toy for toddlers (~2 years old) featuring a coloured LED matrix display that shows animations when buttons are pressed. The child presses a button with a picture (heart, star, etc.) and the display shows an animated version.

## Recommended Approach: Pimoroni Stellar Unicorn

After researching options, the **Pimoroni Stellar Unicorn** is the ideal choice for rapid prototyping:

### Why Stellar Unicorn?
- **All-in-one solution**: 16x16 RGB LED matrix with Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W built-in
- **No soldering required**: Fully assembled, ready to program
- **Battery-ready**: Built-in JST-PH connector for battery power
- **Built-in buttons**: 9 tactile buttons already on board (can be used or bypassed)
- **Easy programming**: MicroPython with Pimoroni's PicoGraphics library
- **Perfect size**: 6mm LED spacing gives ~10cm display area
- **Audio capable**: Built-in speaker for sound feedback

### Input Recommendation: Large Arcade Buttons
- **30mm arcade buttons** mounted in the wooden enclosure
- More intuitive for toddlers than RFID (immediate cause-effect)
- No loose parts that can be lost
- Can have symbols engraved/painted on button caps
- Easy to wire to GPIO pins

## Estimated Total Cost

| Category | Cost |
|----------|------|
| Stellar Unicorn | £39.00 |
| Arcade Buttons (6x) | £15.00 |
| LiPo Battery + Charger | £18.00 |
| Wood & Veneer | £15.00 |
| Miscellaneous (wire, screws, etc.) | £10.00 |
| **Total** | **~£97.00** |

## Key Components
- Pimoroni Stellar Unicorn (16x16 RGB LED matrix with Pico 2 W)
- 6x 30mm arcade push buttons (various colours)
